Hi, humans!!!

Hafizhah's here! Just call me Fifi as my nickname. If you don't mind, you can follow my insta at hafizhahfifi. Don't worry, darling, I'm gonna followback you immediately. 
I like writing some poems or any else sometimes, babbling many different stuffs, One Direction, and The Vamps.
I warn to you that the world is so f*cking vicious. It's quiet rare to connect with people who has truly sincere favor.
People willingly lend their hands if only if you switch what they're gonna do by a mount of fresh sheets. 
So, please, hold on and don't be pathetic ongoing! I believe that one day we can arrive at our own destiny. 
Cheer uppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp!
