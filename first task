#hello-world

Hi, humans!!!

Hafizhah's here! Just call me Fifi as my nickname. I like writing some poems or any else sometimes, One Direction, and The Vamps.
I warn to you that the world is so f*cking vicious. It's quiet rare to connect with people who has truly sincere favor.
People willingly lend their hands if only if you pay them by a mount of fresh sheets. 
So, please, hold on and don't be pathetic! I believe that one day we can arrive at our own destiny. 
Cheer uppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp!
